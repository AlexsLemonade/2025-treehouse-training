This will be a hands-on workshop, so to maximize our time, we would like you to arrive having completed a number of setup tasks, namely setting up accounts, installing software that we will be using, and forking and cloning the workshop repository.

We will _not_ have time to do all of the setup on the days of the workshop and accomplish all of our goals for the workshop!
Please be aware this setup process may take 1-2 hours to complete if you are using Windows, and somewhat less on a Mac.
If you already have R, RStudio, conda, and Git installed, you may be able to skip some of the steps below.

## Workshop software requirements

You will need to install conda, R, RStudio, several R packages, GitKraken, and a suitable text editor, as well as any system dependencies required for these programs.
For Windows users, you will also need to first install Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL 2).

You may already have some of this software installed, but we encourage you to read through all of the instructions at the links below that pertain to your system.
This is especially important for Windows users given the WSL 2 setup, which can be quite time-consuming.

Please follow the instructions below for your given operating system:

- [macOS installation instructions](mac_installation_instructions.md)
- [Windows installation instructions](windows_installation_instructions.md)

As part of this setup, you will also need to create a [GitHub.com](https://github.com) account if you do not already have one.
You will also need to [configure the GitKraken application](github_gitkraken_setup_instructions.md) to interact with GitHub.

## Fork and clone the workshop repository

You will need to fork the workshop repository (<https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/rrp-workshop-exercises/>) to your own GitHub account and clone it to your local machine.

Navigate to <https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/rrp-workshop-exercises/> and follow the GitHub instructions for creating a fork: <https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository>

Once you have forked the repository, you will need to clone it to your local machine.
You can do this using the GitKraken application or the command line.

You can follow the instructions for cloning the repository using GitKraken: <https://www.gitkraken.com/learn/git/git-clone#how-to-git-clone-over-https-using-the-command-line> or the command line: <https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo#cloning-your-forked-repository>.
